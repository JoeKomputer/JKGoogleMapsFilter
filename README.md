JKGoogleMapsFilter
==================

Google Maps Checkbox Filter

A filter for google maps that I created since I couldnt find a simple JS solution anywhere. 
Have to enable geolocation in order for script to find current location and work. (If running locally it runs best in Safari).

TODO: Remove Jquery dependency, although only the checkboxes use jquery.
